# `CFEX` API Reference - #v1

## REST APIs
The REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write ASE package data. Create a new Package, read user and more. The REST API identifies warehouses using `ASE Private Key`. Contact us for APK.

## Overview
Below are the documents that will help you get going with the REST APIs as quickly as possible

 - [API Rate Limiting](#api-rate)
 - [Auth private key](#key)
 - [Member search](#user)
 - [Package](#package)
 	- [Add new one](#add)
 	- [Send it](#send)


## API Rate Limiting
Rate limiting of the API is primarily considered on a per-warehouse basis â€” or more accurately described, per access private key. If a method allows for 60 requests per rate limit window, then it allows you to make 60 requests per window per leveraged access key.

## Auth Private Key
ASE API auth with APK. ASE Private Key (APK) is self-contained way for securely transmitting information between us. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed for our system. **You have to send `key`  parameter at every request.**

## Introduction
All links are relative to **https://api.cfex.az/v1**. For ex. **/user** refers to **https://api.cfex.az/v1/user**.
